# TinyMPC

Model-predictive control on resource-constrained microcontrollers

If you have any questions related to the solver, visit the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/TinyMPC/discussions) page. This guarantees accessibility for everyone.

The documentation is available at [tinympc.org](https://tinympc.org/)

High-level language interfaces with detailed examples are available in [Python](https://github.com/TinyMPC/tinympc-python), [Julia](https://github.com/TinyMPC/tinympc-julia), and [MATLAB](https://github.com/TinyMPC/tinympc-matlab).

## Building

1. On terminal, clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TinyMPC/TinyMPC.git
```

2. Navigate to root directory and run

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

3. Run CMake configure step

```bash
cmake ../
```

4. Build TinyMPC

```bash
make 
```

## Examples

* Run the `quadrotor_hovering` example

```bash
./examples/quadrotor_hovering
```

* Run the `codegen_cartpole` example then follow the same building steps inside that directory

```bash
./examples/codegen_cartpole
```
